# Taulia-Tech-Assessment

Hello everyone! My name is Jean-Luc and this is my submission for the position of UI Software Engineer. This assessment contains the completed code with a few extra added features for better readability.

Side Note: Because my MacBook crashed mid-way into the assessment, I had to complete the rest on my much older Windows laptop. If there are any issues running the application because of this, please let me know.
